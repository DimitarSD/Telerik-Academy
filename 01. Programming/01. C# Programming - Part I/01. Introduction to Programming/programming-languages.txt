Java:
 
Java is one of the most popular computer programming language. It is class-based and object-oriented. Java applications 
are compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. 

C# and Java
Similarities: C# and Java are class-based and object-oriented.They are type-safe languages and in both of them all objects are references.
Both languages have built-in garbage collection.

Differences: Unlike C#, which will only run on Windows, Java runs of Windows, Lunix and other platforms. There are also differences in the 
keywords - some of them are supported in C# but not in Java.

C++: 

C++ is a general-purpose programming language (designed by Bjarne Stroustrup), which has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming 
features, while also providing the facilities for low-level memory manipulation.Many programming languages have been influenced by C++ - C#, Java.

C# and C++
Similarities: They both have objects.

Differences: C++ supports multiple inheritance, C# does not. The syntax looks similar, but under the covers they are very different. 
C++ is generally compiled to native code, C# is generally compiled to intermediate language bytecode.

Python: 

Python is high-level programming language, which was designed by Guido van Rossum. Its syntax allows programmers to express 
concepts in fewer lines of code. Python interpreters are available for installation on many operating systems, allowing Python code 
execution on a wide variety of systems.

C# and Python
Similarities: Both Python and C# are object-oriented.

Differences: Python is better in readability, C# has more consistent syntax.

Ruby: 

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented and general-purpose programming language. It supports multiple programming paradigms, 
including functional, object-oriented, and imperative. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management. It was designed by
Yukihiro Matsumoto.

C# and Ruby
Similarities: Both Ruby and C# are object-oriented.

Differences: Ruby is an interpreted language and C# is a compiled language.Unlike C#, Ruby has no debugging mode.
Ruby manages its memery usage with the method of reference counting and C# follows generational garbage collection method.

JavaScript: 

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is used in Web site development.JavaScript uses some of the same 
ideas found in Java, the compiled object-oriented programming derived from C++.

C# and JavaScript
Differences: Javascript is a non-typed scripting language, which means it typically runs uncompiled in browsers. C# is a strongly-typed language.
